Modeling Featherweight Java in Coq

This project provides type and Syntax Modeling of Featherweight Java, a minimal calculus of the parent Java language.

The Coq source file "FJ.v" models the primitives of Featherweight Java, such as

-> Abstract syntax for classes, constructors, method declarations
-> Type system implementation, as per FJ whitepaper
-> Cast constructs defined inductively, with stated lemmas
